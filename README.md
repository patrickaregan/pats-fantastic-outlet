# Pat's Fantastic Outlet

## Description

  - The backend for an e-commerce site that sells just about anything, as long as it's fantastic!
  - E-commerce is a big business and it is important for developers to know how to build sites that allow businesses to sell products online.
  - I wanted to take my development to the next level and work on an e-commerce project because that is something I would likely work on in my career as a web developer.
  - This project exposes APIs you can use to manage Products, Categories and Tags. You can group Products in Categories and tag Products with Tags.
  - I learned how to the Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. What was most impressive about Sequelize to me is how easy it is to manage the One-to-Many and Many-to-Many relationships.
